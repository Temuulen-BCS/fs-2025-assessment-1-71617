This project uses .NET 8 Web API that exposes real-time Dublin Bikes station data.

Loading stations from JSON (V1)

Searching, filtering, sorting & paging

Automatic background updates every 10–20 seconds

POST / PUT / DELETE for CRUD operations

In-memory caching for faster and effective performance

Postman automated testing collection

Clean architecture (Models - Services - Controllers)

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT ?

1. Make sure you are on .NET 8 SDK.
2. dotnet run or press green play button on top
3. You would see this in API
GET     /api/v1/stations
GET     /api/v1/stations/{number}
GET     /api/v1/stations/summary
POST    /api/v1/stations
PUT     /api/v1/stations/{number}
DELETE  /api/v1/stations/{number}
4. From here you can add bikes or remove or see an existing bike if its available or not. (thats everything)
